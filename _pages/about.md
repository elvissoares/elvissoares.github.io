I am an Assistant Professor of Molecular Engineering in the [Chemical Engineering Program (PEQ)](https://www.peq.coppe.ufrj.br/global/index.php/en/) of [COPPE](https://coppe.ufrj.br/en/home-en/) at [Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro (UFRJ)](https://ufrj.br/en/). My main research interests are thermodynamics, statistical and quantum physics, with emphasis on liquids, electrolytes, colloids, and interfaces, spanning applications from soft matter to chemical engineering.

I have a PhD degree (2017) and a BSc degree (2011) in Physics from UFRJ. I was a postdoctoral researcher in the ATOMS group at the School of Chemistry at UFRJ between 2020 and 2024. I also served as a substitute professor at the Institute of Physics at UFRJ from 2013 to 2014, and again from 2017 to 2018. Additionally, I conducted a postdoctoral fellowship at NIDF from 2017 to 2019 in the field of fluid dynamics and turbulence. My doctoral research (2012â€“2017), carried out in the ICE group, focused on applying Non-Equilibrium Thermodynamics to Type Ia Supernova explosions.
